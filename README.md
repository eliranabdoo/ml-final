To run the program, install the requirements specified under reqs.txt and run "python main.py"

To tune the hyperparameters of the baseline model (LightGBM) see the constant.py file (these are taken from exercise 2) - "comp_model_params" in constant.py .
To tune the hyperparameter of the compared model (RBoost or EPLBoost) see the main.py file (variable named "model_params")

Switch between RBoost and EPLBoost using the USE_RBOOST flag in constant.py
